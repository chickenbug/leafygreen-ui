## Icon creation guide

The LeafyGreen system icons are a clear and concise set of glyphs designed to be minimal in form and express a variety of use-cases for all digital products

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 277px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/icon-creation-1@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

### Our icon set is created collaboratively

We want to build out a universal icon set together. Here are some things to keep in mind.

- Icons should represent real world things.
- Icons should not represent overly complex things, like CalendarEventJulyFourth.
- Refer to this guide and existing icons while building your icon.

### How to create an icon

Follow these steps to help maintain a consitent look across new and existing icons

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 180px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/icon-creation-2@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

### Stroke Weight of Negative Space

Negative space is a defining feature of our icon set. For optimal rendering and legibility, the stroke width should vary to appear better optically. When designing icons, use the following stroke weights:

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 177px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/icon-creation-3@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

### Corner Radius

The icon set has predominately rounded corners and caps, but itâ€™s important to note that it also allows for sharp corners occasionally

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 174px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/icon-creation-4@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

### Things to avoid while creating

To ensure consistency and quality for your icon avoid these common mistakes

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 173px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/icon-creation-5@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

### How to prepare your final icon

Follow these steps to help maintain a consitent look across new and existing icons.

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
