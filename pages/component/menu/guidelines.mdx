Menus are used when a user needs to take an action.

Menus are not select inputs. In a select input a selection is being made. In a menu a user takes an action (like copy/delete a property or navigate to a different section/screen).

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 390px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/LM-menus-1@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

Menus can be triggered in many ways, such as via an ellipsis, or with a button. Avoid using plain text or a link as a trigger for a menu.

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 237px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/LM-menus-2@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

Menus come in a default and large size. For menus that have more items use the default size menu. For menus that have nested items use the large size.

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 410px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/LM-menus-3@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>

Menus can also act as a buffer to help prevent misclicks, and are often used where a user would expect that action to live, like near a table label for deleting a column.

<div
  className={css`
    margin: 40px 0px;
    width: auto;
    height: 250px;
    background-image: url('${CDN}/images/guidelines/LM-menus-4@3x.png');
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
  `}
/>
